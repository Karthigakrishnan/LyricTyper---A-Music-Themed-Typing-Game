0:Twinkle twinkle little star
5:How I wonder what you are
10:Up above the world so high
15:Like a diamond in the sky
20:When the blazing sun is gone
25:When he nothing shines upon
30:Then you show your little light
35:Twinkle twinkle all the night
40:Then the traveler in the dark
45:Thanks you for your tiny spark
